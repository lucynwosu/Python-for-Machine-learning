## Python-for-Machine-learning

### Description 

This is a tutorial porfolio that provides simple hands-on that uses scikit_Learn to explain how to buld machine learning algorithms. Algorithms covered are listed below:

Data Preprocessing<br>
Linear Regression<br>
Logistic Regression<br>
Decision Tree<br>
K-Means Clustering<br>
Dimension Reduction -Principal Component Analysis(PCA)<br>
Dimension Reduction - Auto-Encoders
Feature Selection<br>
Support Vector Machine(SVM) <br>
Model Performance Comparison<br>

Building a machine learning model has been described using the following simple steps

### 1. Data Gathering
### 2. Data Cleaning/Pre-processing
### 3. Data Visualization/Analysis
### 4. Data Split(Train/Test)/Model Training)
### 5. Model Evaluation/Testing


### Dataset

All data is provided as a link in the jupyter notebook or can downloaded and stored in the the data folder of this repository.
