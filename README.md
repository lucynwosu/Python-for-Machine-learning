## Python-for-Machine-learning

**Description** 

This is a tutorial porfolio that provides simple hands-on that uses scikit_Learn to explain how to buld machine learning algorithms. Algorithms covered are listed below:

**Data Preprocessing<br>
Linear Regression<br>
Logistic Regression<br>
Decision Tree<br>
K-Means Clustering<br>
Dimension Reduction -Principal Component Analysis(PCA)<br>
Dimension Reduction - Auto-Encoders
Feature Selection<br>
Support Vector Machine(SVM) <br>
Model Performance Comparison<br>**

Building a machine learning model has been described using the following simple steps

**1. Data Gathering<br>**
**2. Data Cleaning/Pre-processing<br>**
**3. Data Visualization/Analysis<br>**
**4. Data Split(Train/Test)/Model Training)<br>**
**5. Model Evaluation/Testing<br>**

**Dataset**

All data is provided as a link in the jupyter notebook or can downloaded and stored in the the data folder of this repository.
